1. I decided to use java for this program. I used java.io.BufferedReader and java.io.FileReader to parse the csv file and also used some libraries to help implement the data structures I wanted to use. I used a hashmap because of its efficeny over arraylists. However, I needed to use an arraylist for more dynamic allocations, which also allows for any csv to be parsed into an arraylist.

2. The advantages of my program is the readability of it and the encapsulation using methods. I also utilized various classes which allow for cleaner code in this case. I believe I could have used more generics to make my program more reusable. I also most likely should have used python for its wider range of libraries in data processing and csv scraping. I know pandas is a very powerful library I've used before, but I am more comfortable with implementing data structures in java.

3. I am currently doing research for Dr. Aussie Suzuki in pattern classification of chromosomal abnormalities. I love the freedom of trying out various methods via trial and error, but it is certainly challenging to read through a lot of research papers beforehand as they can be fairly dense. I am getting a lot better at formulating a structure around each approach I take and documenting what I tried, and learning what there is to improve. Overall, it has been a very fun and rewarding experience so far.
